# EuterpeaScala
A Scala project loosely modeled on the Yale Haskell Euterpea project (Haskell School of Music), 
from where I have stolen the name. 

Euterpe was the ancient greek muse of music - the less well known sister of Terpsichore, muse of dance.

This is certainly not a port of the Yale Euterpea from Haskell to Scala, 
but aims to achieve similar capability (and perhaps more) for Midi music only.

It aims to have a concise music notation for fast and easy transcription of music, with a very uniform syntax, 
while allowing a rich set of musical capability and performance. It supports multiple tracks, multiple instruments,
dynamics on volume and note width. In due course, it will support stress patterns for phrasing of bars, 
and timing adjustments for humanisation and swing.

It should be seen as a work-in-progress and also as a platform to improve my understanding of Scala's capabilities.
